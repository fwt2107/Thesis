This file merges the county-level and state-level final datasets into 1 dataset.

# Read in datasets
```{r}
county_df <- read_csv('./Cleaned data/County/final_df.csv') %>% 
  filter(usable == T) %>% 
  rename(geography = county,
         geography_code = county_code,
         state_group = state) %>% 
  select(-c(usable, suppressed, unreliable))

state_df <- read_csv('./Cleaned data/State/state_final_df.csv') %>% 
  mutate(state_group = state) %>% 
  rename(geography = state,
         geography_code = state_code)
```



# Merge and save
```{r}
merged_df <- bind_rows(county_df, state_df)

write_csv(merged_df, './Cleaned data/merged_df.csv')
```
