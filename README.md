# Thesis
This repository contains the R code and output I create for my thesis.

There are 3 purposes for me using a github repository: 

1. Ensure all analyses and results I produce are reproducible. Anyone can run my code with the same data and come up with the same results

2. Keep my work organized

3. Force myself to deliberately plan out and decide what code I need to write/edit and to document those changes/additions
